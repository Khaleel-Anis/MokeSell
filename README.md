# MokeSell
MokeSell is an intuitive e-commerce web application designed for seamless buying and selling of products online. It supports categories like Clothing, Luxury Items, and Electronics, providing both buyers and sellers with a user-friendly platform.

# Design Process

User Stories:
- As a buyer, I want to search for products quickly to find items that meet my needs.

- As a user, I want to manage my cart and wishlist effectively.
- As a buyer, I want to chat with sellers to negotiate deals or ask questions.
